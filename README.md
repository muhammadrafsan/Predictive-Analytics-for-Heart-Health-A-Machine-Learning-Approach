# Predictive-Analytics-for-Heart-Health-A-Machine-Learning-Approach

In this project, we have analysed a person’s heart health condition and predict whether they have any heart disease using various Machine Learning approaches. Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, remains a leading global cause of death. 
For our analysis, we have utilized a dataset titled ”Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease,” which encompasses a total of 17 features. Among these, 9 are boolean data, 5 are strings, and 4 are decimal values. Our approach began with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, followed by the implementation of common Machine Learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost, Ada Boost, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Nearest Neighbor.
